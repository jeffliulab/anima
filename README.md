# ANIMA O1

**ANIMA Open, Generation 1** — an open-source cognitive framework for home robots.

ANIMA = **A**utonomous **N**atural-language **I**nstruction **M**apping **A**rchitecture.

It turns natural-language instructions ("put the pen in the box") into grounded, executable robot behaviors by combining LLM-based parsing with classical symbolic planning and a behavior-tree runtime.

## What it is (and is not)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Is** | A reusable cognitive layer for robots running ROS 2. Parses instructions, plans tasks, dispatches skills, validates execution. |
| **Is not** | A motion planner, a perception model, a hardware driver. ANIMA *coordinates* these — it does not replace them. |

ANIMA is the brain shared across the **Soma Homies** robot family ([soma_home_exp_v1](https://github.com/jeffliulab/soma_home_exp_v1) is the first robot using it), but it is designed to be robot-agnostic.

## Status

**Pre-alpha.** This is the v1 (`O1`) open-source line — the first generation we are willing to put under public version control. Expect frequent breaking changes until we cut a `0.1.0` tag.

Design docs (Chinese, more abstract) live in [`SOMA/ANIMA_FRAMEWORK/`](https://github.com/jeffliulab/SOMA) — that's where ideas are sketched before they land here.

## Architecture (planned)

```
       natural language instruction
                  │
                  ▼
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  LLM Parser     │  instruction → TaskSpec (structured)
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  Task Planner   │  TaskSpec → BehaviorTree
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  Skill Registry │  selects + dispatches primitive skills
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  Skill Executor │  ROS 2 actions / services to robot
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  Validator      │  test-and-check before reporting success
        └─────────────────┘
```

Core design principle, borrowed from the DIARC literature: **LLM-as-a-Parser, not LLM-as-a-Translator.** The LLM produces structured task representations that downstream symbolic components can verify, instead of generating low-level commands directly.

## Repository layout

More structure will be added as the framework grows. See the design docs for the planned full layout.
